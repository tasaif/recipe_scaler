#The first “chili” recipes appeared in West Texas at
#the turn of the century.  They may have had their
#origin from old Mexican recipes, but since most
#cowboys couldn't read...or for that matter, cook very
#good, chili most probably got it’s start due to the
#availability of spices and other ingredients available
#in the area.  A lot of ingredients available to us now
#were just not available then.  Most chili consisted of
#beef, cumin, pepper, sugar, paprika, garlic, and masa
#to thicken. Tomatoes were seasonal and usually not
#available.  Chili powder was not manufactured at the
#time...They used dried chili’s (spanish for
#peppers)...most west texas cowboys were Mexican.
#Most of the original chili did not have beans due to
#the time required to soak and cook them...chuck wagons
#did not appear til later in history and even then, on
#most ranches, the cowboy was on his own and didn't
#have time to watch beans all day.
